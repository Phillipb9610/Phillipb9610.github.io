I'm a computer science student at CSUF and I expect to graduate in 2028.

## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs
* Lab 1, part 1
    This is one of my favorite labs because this was the introduction to all future labs and coding. I had to learn how to download Linux onto a blank laptop which was fun but a little confusing at first. I also had to download git codes which before that lab I always thought you never needed to download codes for it to work, I was very surprised and cool.

* Lab 3, part 2
    This was my second favorite lab because we had to write code for two parts that used variables, initialization, arithmetic operators, input, output, and functions. The first part calculated BMR for men and women, and the second part created an equation that calculated the difference in dates. This was a lot of fun because I got to see how I can use code to automate any real-world equation or problem.

* Lab 7, part 3
    This was my third favorite lab because we had to write code for one part that used if statements with compound Boolean expressions that implement domain logic. We had to write a program that determines whether street parking is allowed, according to posted signs. This was a lot of fun because it was so cool seeing how I can use code to tell me if places are open from the information I provide.
